So with millions of citizens still trying to figure out how to deal with the fall out from the virus, the hypocrites Trumplicans in the Senate are more worried about slamming through a judicial nomination. In a country that continues to contend that it is a democracy, power sure does lay in the hands of a few. They don't care about the citizens of this country. Their actions show they represent those that can make their wallets fatter. In turn they legislate for those few. It is disgusting!

They and their supporters like to talk about freedom while waving the flag. Then turn around and make laws restricting others rights because they or their religion forbid those rights. Those of us that are not religious should not have to live with the dogma of those that are. If people want to believe in unprovable superstitions that is there right, but is is my right not to. 

So now it might happen that millions could lose health care and roe v. wade is being called back into question all because a religious whack job will be on the court. For people who pretend to care about life, McConnell and his minions sure do make it hard for those of us that actually have to work to survive. They are really just pro-fetus. Once born your on your own.

So it will be interesting to see how the future unfolds. Once all the old white corrupt pieces of human excrement are gone hopefully we can get back to a place where facts matter. We all need to get off social media, that is not news and work to keep us distracted from the truth. The truth that we the American people have been getting reamed in the rear for along time but now, lube is no longer used and our anuses are bleeding.
