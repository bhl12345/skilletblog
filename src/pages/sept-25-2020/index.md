excerpt: 'Two charged for Covid response. Why not Trump?'
---
A Massachusetts grand jury has indicted two individuals for their Covid-19 responses at an aging veterans home. The two people indicted are Former Holyoke Soldiers, 
Home Superintendent Bennett Walsh, as well as former Medical Director David Clinton. Each is charged with 10 counts; 
five counts of criminal neglect and five counts of serious bodily injury.

My question is, if 76 lives are worth bringing an indictment against these two, why not Trump?
Over 200,000 deaths are lost (and counting), while he plays golf, watches TV, and insults anyone who does not agree with him. We all 
have heard the asinine statements he has made on this subject. In my opinion, we will just have to add this to the long list of  
his many crimes.
