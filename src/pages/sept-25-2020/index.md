excerpt: 'Two charged for Covid response. Why not Trump?'
---
So a Massachusetts grand jury has indicted  two individuals for their Covid-19 reponse at a aging veterans home. The two are Former Holyoke Soldiers 
Home Superintendent Bennett Walsh as well as former Medical Director David Clinton. Each is charged with 10 counts. 
Five counts of criminal neglect and five counts of serious bodily injury.

So My question is if 76 lives are worth bringing an indictment against these two why not Trump?
I mean over 200,000 deaths and counting while he plays golf watches TV and insults anyone who does not agree with him. We all 
have heard the asinine statements he has made on this subject. I guess we will just have to add this the long list of what in 
my view are his many crimes.
