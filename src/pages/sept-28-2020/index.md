## Is this really a surprise

I am amused by the reaction to the news about "the Donald." To me, this just verifies what his actions have dictated since day one. He has never been a good businessman, husband, or father. Not to mention the disaster he has been as president.

The problem for me is that the people who support him believe everything he says is true, this is just not the case. They worship at the alter of "Dumb Donny T." He is their fuhrer. In my view they are not Americans or Republicans, they are "Trumplicans." Which I am sure is fine by them.

I suggest we give them North and South Dakota and they can have their own country, Trumplanidia. Then we can build a wall around our border. That is at least a start to try and restore whatever is left of democracy. What a wonderful world it would be. :)
