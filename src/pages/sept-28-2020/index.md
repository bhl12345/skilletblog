## Is this really a surprise

I am amused by the reaction to the news about the Donald. To me, this just verifies what his actions have dicated since day one. He has never been a good businessman, husband, father not to mention the cluster he has been as president.

The problem for me is that the many people who believe what he says is true or don't care that it is true. They worship at the alter of Dumb Donny J and he is their fuhrer. In my view they are not Americans or Republicans they are Trumplicans. Which I am sure is fine by them.

I suggest we give them North and South Dakota and they can have their own country, Trumplanidia. Then we can build a wall around our border. That is at least a start to try and restore whatever is left of democracy. What a wonderful world it would be.
