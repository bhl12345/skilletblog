excerpt: 'Our election process is a joke'
---
As we sit here the day after voting ended waiting to see if we have to continue and live with the orange menace. One has
to wonder why our election process is so flawed. If we used the popular vote the story would have a different narrative. 
Currently as of this writing the orange menace is down by just about 3 million votes. Here in the self-described cradle of democracy that does not matter.
The United States more resembles a fast food commercial than a democratic republic. The burger looks all juicy and delicious 
and when you get one it looks like a car has run over it. Here everyone gets all worked up about voting, but it really 
comes down to a few states that do not necessarily represent the values of the nation as a whole.
